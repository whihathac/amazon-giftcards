## Dependencies:
* VS 2017/.NET 4.6
* Nuget packages:
  * Selenium.Support
  * Selenium.WebDriver
  * Selenium.WebDriver.ChromeDriver

## Usage:

Open the C# project/sln and replace the following variables:

        private const double GIFT_CARD_AMOUNT = 0.5;
        private const string AMAZON_USERNAME = "";
        private const string AMAZON_PASSWORD = ""; 
        private const string DEBIT_CARD_NUMBER = ""; // Update debit card info here
        private const int NUMBER_OF_RELOADS = 2; // Update the number of reloads to be done with this card


To be sure, I would start with low number of reloads.
